# Tasks for the PyGPTCourse

At a high level we have these tasks to complete

1. Chapters in the book
2. Prepare code sample

## Principles

1. Keep It Simple
2. Have all code and associated documentation in Git repository

## Chapters in the book

- Write the chapters - Shiva - DONE
- Review the chapters - Murali

## Code Sample

Each of these items have a "create, review, fix, publish" steps in them.

- OKRs - Shiva
    Once we agree on OKRs, get it into the git repo itself
- Requirements
    Bulk upload all requirements summary into the git repo itself
    If possible, directly create requirements inside git repo
- Issue Management
    Bulk upload all issues summary into the git repo itself
    If possible, directly create issues inside git repo
- Design Documents
    Architecture, Design, Block diagrams, etc.
- Implementation - draft 1 working code
    All code goes into src/
- Refactoring using SOLID principles
- Testing
    Test cases, unit tests, functional tests, etc.
- Deployment using CICD
- Observability
    Did it work?
    Did the implementation meet key results?

## Project Timeline

The intent is to get all this done by Dec 15th.
Anticipation is 4-hours per week for 5 weeks => 4*5 = 20 hours
